# My-Devops-Learning-Journey
Documenting my devops journey, learnings, and everything in between.

#DevOps Learning Logs – by Arnab Nandi

Welcome to my personal DevOps learning log 📘  
This repository is where I document my journey from a non-tech background into the world of DevOps, Cloud, and Infrastructure.

Each log entry here links to a detailed blog post published on [Hashnode](https://learning-out-loud-my-devops-journey.hashnode.dev), where I write about what I’ve learned, struggled with, and explored — all in a beginner-friendly, story-driven format.

## 💡 Why I'm Doing This

I believe the best way to learn is by teaching, sharing, and reflecting. This repo (and my blog) are my open notes — where I think out loud, make mistakes, and grow in public.  
If you're someone transitioning into tech or curious about DevOps, I hope this helps you too.
